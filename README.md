# MIPS-VGA
This is the project I did over my 2023 spring break. The intial goal was to display a video onto a VGA display using the VGA port of a ![Digilent Basys 3](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/basys-3/reference-manual). The Basys 3 has signaifigantly less space then I had initially expected, which reduced my goal to a single image. By the end of my break, my goal was reduced even further as one 640x480 image in binary color was too large. I could have reduced the image size, but I have run out of time and there are other things I need to do. 

## Update
After another two days of work (after I decided I was done with this) I have added another iteration of the project which is much more simple and effiecient then the whole processor. It doesn't work yet, as the timings are a bit weird, but I will update if I get it working.
